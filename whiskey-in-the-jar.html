    <h1>
        whiskey in the jar<br>
    </h1>

    <p>
        as i was flyin' over<br>
        the phosphorescent mountains<br>
        i spotted captain farrow<br>
        & the money he was countin'<br>
        i first produced my pistol<br>
        then produced my rapier<br>
        sayin' stand & deliver<br>
        for i am the boldest savior<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        whiskey in the jar —<br>
        one for my daddy-o<br>
        & one for my mommy-o<br>
        there's whiskey in the jar<br>
        whiskey in the jar —<br>
        one for my daddy-o<br>
        & one for my mommy-o<br>
        there's whiskey in the jar<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        i took his gold & silver<br>
        he paid a pretty penny<br>
        i put it in my pocket<br>
        & i took it home to jenny<br>
        she laughed & she cried<br>
        & gave to me a baby<br>
        sayin' stand by me woman<br>
        if the tramp, then you're the lady<br>
    </p>
