        whiskey in the jar<br>
    </h1>
    <p>
        as i was flyin' over<br>
        the phosphorescent mountains<br>
        i spotted captain farrow<br>
        & the money he was countin'<br>
        i first produced my pistol<br>
        —then produced a sabre<br>
        sayin' "stand & deliver!"<br>
        final dance upon this razor...<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        whiskey in the jar—<br>
        one for my daddy-o<br>
        one for my mommy-o<br>
        there's whiskey in the jar<br>
        whiskey in the jar—<br>
        one for my daddy-o<br>
        one for my mommy-o<br>
        there's whiskey in the jar<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        i took his gold & silver<br>
        —paid a pretty penny<br>
        & i put it in my pocket<br>
        for to take it home to jenny<br>
        she laughed & she cried...<br>
        & gave to me a baby—<br>
        sayin' "stand by me woman!"<br>
        be the tramp if you're my lady<br>
    </p>
