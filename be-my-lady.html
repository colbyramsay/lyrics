        lady will you wear this dress for me?<br>

        will you keep the gate open wide<br>
        —take all that i've got inside<br>
        & lady will you do it all for free?<br>

        will you scream out into the night<br>
        —'til i don't know what is black or white<br>
        & lady will you do it all for free?<br>
