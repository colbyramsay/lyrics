    <h1>
       don't worry baby<br>
    </h1>
    <p>
        was walkin' down the side of the road<br>
        when i saw you were lookin' at me<br>
        the light shone down 'pon us from the big house<br>
        bodies shakin' like the stone of the lee<br>
        had you for a moment in time—<br>
        when i woke there was nothin' to see<br>
        crushed leaves on the ground 'neath the big house<br>
        hallowed ground where i planted a seed<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        don't worry baby—<br>
        three little birds'll come & make it right<br>
        don't worry baby—<br>
        make it through the minute—make it the night<br>
        don't worry baby—<br>
        there'll be milk & honey on the otherly side<br>
        don't worry baby—<br>
        if your feet are slippin'—teach you to slide<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        was waitin' on a sawtooth babe—<br>
        for the one who could cut it for me<br>
        yah crept in through the window like a skylark<br>
        body glowin' like a ziziphus tree<br>
        rock me mama all night long—<br>
        don't you fuss with my reverie<br>
        & keep a fire floatin' by the water's edge<br>
        nothin' left to do but turn in the key<br>
    </p>
